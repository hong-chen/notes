# Install Nest Thermostat

After installation, the thermostat can not get power from the furnace. After hours of
inspection, it turned out the fuse on the furnace motherboard was burned. After replacing
the furnace fuse, everything worked.

Tips:
1. Completely turn off the furnace during the thermostat installation;
2. If the thermostat can't get power, check the fuse on the furnace motherboard;
3. Fuse replacement can be purchased at Home Depot.
